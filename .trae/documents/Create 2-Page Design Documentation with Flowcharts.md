I will now secure your code by committing and pushing it to GitHub.

### **Steps:**
1.  **Verify Remote**: Check if the repository is linked to GitHub (`git remote -v`).
2.  **Stage Changes**: Add all modified files (OCR fixes, Reverted Cloud Sync, Documentation) to the staging area.
3.  **Commit**: Create a snapshot with the message:
    > "Refactor: Revert to local-only mode, fix OCR tax parsing, and add design documentation"
4.  **Push**: Upload the changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

*Note: If authentication is required, I will prompt you to complete the login in the terminal.*
